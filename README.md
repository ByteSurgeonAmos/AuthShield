  - Returns URL format: `https://robohash.org/{seed}.png?{style}&{bg}&size=200x200`

### 3. Enhanced User Registration (auth.service.ts)

- **Features**:
  - Automatic random username generation if none provided
  - Random profile image generation for all new users
  - Returns profile image URL in registration response
  - Maintains existing email verification and security features

### 4. Security Questions System

- **Entity**: `src/auth/entities/security-question.entity.ts`
- **DTOs**: `src/auth/dto/security-question.dto.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Set security question and answer (hashed with SHA-256)
  - Verify security question answer
  - Update security question with one-time change restriction
  - Get current security question (without answer)
  - Delete security question
  - Audit trail for all security question operations

### 5. Username Change Restrictions

- **Location**: `auth.service.ts` - `update()` method
- **Features**:
  - Users can only change username once (similar to security questions)
  - Username uniqueness validation
  - Security audit logging for username changes
  - Tracks old and new username in audit logs

### 6. Third-Party Authentication Enhancement

- **Location**: `auth.service.ts` - `thirdPartyAuth()` method
- **Features**:
  - Enhanced social login with Google/Facebook
  - Automatic random username generation for social users
  - Profile image handling (uses provided or generates random)
  - Account status validation
  - Login notifications and audit logging
  - JWT token generation with user details

### 7. Complete Security Questions API Endpoints

- **Location**: `src/auth/auth.controller.ts`
- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /users/security-question/set` - Set security question
  - `POST /users/security-question/verify` - Verify answer
  - `PATCH /users/security-question/update` - Update question (one-time)
  - `GET /users/security-question` - Get current question
  - `DELETE /users/security-question` - Delete security question

## Module Updates ✅

### Auth Module Configuration

- **Location**: `src/auth/auth.module.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Added SecurityQuestion entity to TypeORM configuration
  - All dependencies properly injected and exported

## Security Features ✅

### 1. Password Hashing

- All user passwords hashed with bcrypt (salt rounds: 12)
- Security question answers hashed with SHA-256

### 2. One-Time Change Restrictions

- Security questions can only be changed once per user
- Username can only be changed once per user
- Both restrictions enforced at service level

### 3. Audit Logging

- All security-related operations logged
- Username changes tracked with old/new values
- Security question operations audited
- Failed authentication attempts recorded

### 4. Input Validation

- Comprehensive DTO validation for all endpoints
- Username uniqueness checks
- Email format validation
- Required field validation

## Database Schema ✅

### Security Questions Table

```sql
- user_id (UUID, Foreign Key)
- question (VARCHAR)
- answer_hash (VARCHAR, SHA-256)
- is_changed (BOOLEAN, default: false)
- created_at (TIMESTAMP)
- updated_at (TIMESTAMP)
```

### User Account Table Updates

- `username_changed` field for tracking username modifications
- Profile image URLs stored in user responses

## API Documentation

### User Registration Response

```json
{
  "userId": "uuid",
  "username": "CryptoMaster1234",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "profileImage": "https://robohash.org/seed.png?set=set1&bg1&size=200x200",
  "message": "User created successfully. Please check your email for verification."
}
```

### Security Question Operations

All security question endpoints require JWT authentication and return standardized responses with success messages and security audit trails.

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Username Generation**: Test random username generation and uniqueness
2. **Profile Images**: Verify profile image URLs are generated and accessible
3. **Security Questions**: Test complete CRUD operations with one-time change restriction
4. **Username Changes**: Verify one-time username change limitation
5. **Third-Party Auth**: Test social login flow with random username generation
6. **Security Audit**: Verify all operations are properly logged

## Error Handling ✅

- Comprehensive error handling for all new features
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Descriptive error messages
- Validation error responses
- Database constraint error handling

## Performance Considerations ✅

- Username uniqueness checks optimized with database queries
- Profile image generation uses external service (RoboHash)
- Security question answers properly hashed for security
- Database indexes recommended for frequently queried fields
